It appears that the first concern I must address is what level of precision I want to conduct the study in.  As a clinically oriented project, I am leaning towards gene expression by RNASeq.  This will however, eliminate the possibility of germ line variant calling.  This is not my specialty.  I should consult with Dr. Hicks on this area of the project.
